# Overview

This repository contains my solutions for [EverybodyCodes](https://everybody.codes/) puzzles written in Python.

# Execution

1. Go to the folder `puzzles/{YEAR}/{DAY}` (e.g. `puzzles/2024/08`).
2. Save your input data for parts of the tasks in files named `input1.txt`, `input2.txt` and `input3.txt`.
3. Launch the script with solution: `python3 {DAY}.py`. For some unoptimized solutions execution may take a while.
4. The script will output three strings with the answers for parts of the puzzle.
